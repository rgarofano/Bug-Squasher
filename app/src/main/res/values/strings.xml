    <string name="game_info">\nBug Squasher is a game where the player tries to eliminate a certain number of bugs scattered throughout
                            the Linux Terminal. The goal is to find all the bugs using the least amount of scans.

                            \nTo play the game, the player taps on a cell that they want to inspect. If the cell contains a bug, the
                            bug is squashed. If there is no bug in the selected cell, a scan is instead initiated that counts the
                            number of bugs hidden in the same row and column.\n </string>
