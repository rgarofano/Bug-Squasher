Bug Squasher is a game where the player tries to eliminate a certain number of bugs scattered throughout the Linux Terminal. The goal is to find all the bugs using the least amount of debugs. To play the game, the player taps on a cell that they want to inspect. If the cell contains a bug, the bug is squashed. If there is no bug in the selected cell, a debugger is initiated that finds the number of bugs hidden in the same row and column and displays that number on the selected cell. If a bug has already been squashed and you wish to inspect the cell again, this will also trigger the debugger and display the number of bugs hidden in the selected bug's row and column.

The app starts up to the welcome screen with an animation which can be skipped by pressing the skip button. The user is then greeted by the main menu where they can select to play a game, go to the options screen to edit game details such as the number of bugs and board size, or open the help screen to understand how to play the game. Game data is saved between launches including high scores for each game configuration and the number of times the game has been played.
